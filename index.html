                    <h3>Alphaura</h3>
                    <p>In reality the word <em>"Alphaura"</em> is actualy 2 words, which are <em>"Alpha"</em> and <em>"Aura"</em>. The wording of the 
                        brand name is mainly referring to two things;<br>
                    <br>
                    Alpha; <strong><em>The alpha wolf concept of fighting for what you want, the alpha wave and the power of mindfulness and the flow</em></strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Aura; <strong><em>The wolf's spirit meaning -> Strong connection with your instincts or intuition, High intelligence, Loyalty and communication,
                         Deep desire for freedom</em></strong><br>
                    <br>
                    These are the foundations the name brand is built on. As a person, I've always looked for the next great thing, yet, I've tried too hard, without
                    any doing. Once I understood the myself, my journey, and the meaning and power of mindfulness, I started doing, hence why, I created this brand
                    and its brand name to share this knowledge in a creative way.

                    <h3>Signature</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to create something extra, were one can understand that this is Alphaura, without needing to read the actual brand name,
                         so I created a signature. I wasn't sure what to do as a signature, but one night while I was setting of to sleep, the <em>"Alpha"</em>
                         wave came in and did its thing. The signature is also split in two parts, one being the <em>"A"</em> for Alphaura, and the biggest part is the actual <em>"Alpha Wave"</em>.
